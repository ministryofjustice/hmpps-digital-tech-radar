GitHub Actions is a CI/CD automation tool within GitHub that enables you to build, test, and deploy code automatically. It allows you to create workflows triggered by events like pushes, pull requests, or scheduled times, using YAML configuration files. With GitHub Actions, you can integrate with external services, automate tasks, and manage complex pipelines directly in your GitHub repository.
