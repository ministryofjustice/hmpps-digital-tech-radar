GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI. Integrated into code editors like Intellij, it suggests code snippets, functions, and even whole lines as you type, based on natural language prompts or existing code. Copilot learns from public code repositories, helping developers speed up coding, explore new libraries, and reduce repetitive work.
