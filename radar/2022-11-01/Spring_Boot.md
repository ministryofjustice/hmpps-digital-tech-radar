Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. It provides a set of tools and conventions for building microservices and web applications, allowing developers to create and deploy applications quickly with minimal configuration. Spring Boot includes embedded servers, automatic dependency management, and production-ready features, making it easier to develop robust applications.
