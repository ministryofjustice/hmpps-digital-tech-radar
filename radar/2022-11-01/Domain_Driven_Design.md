Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the problem domain. It focuses on modeling complex systems based on the core business concepts and processes, using a common language (Ubiquitous Language) to align design and implementation with business needs. DDD promotes creating modular, maintainable systems through the identification of bounded contexts, where specific models apply, facilitating better communication and integration across different parts of the application.
