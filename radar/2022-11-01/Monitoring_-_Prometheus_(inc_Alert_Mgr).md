Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit widely used for recording real-time metrics and generating alerts. It collects and stores metrics as time-series data, which can be queried and visualized using its query language, PromQL. Prometheus is especially known for its ability to monitor containerized applications and microservices, providing insights into system performance and health.
