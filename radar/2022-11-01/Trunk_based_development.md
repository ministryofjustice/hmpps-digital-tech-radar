Trunk-Based Development is a software development practice where all developers work on a single branch (the "trunk") of the version control system, integrating their changes frequently, often multiple times a day. This approach minimizes long-lived branches, encourages continuous integration, and helps maintain a stable codebase, reducing the complexity of merging and conflict resolution.
