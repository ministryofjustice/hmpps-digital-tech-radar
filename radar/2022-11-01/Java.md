Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is widely used for building web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise software due to its simplicity, security features, and robustness. Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle, allowing code to run on any device that has the JVM installed.
