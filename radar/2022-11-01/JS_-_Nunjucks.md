Nunjucks is a JavaScript templating engine used for rendering HTML and other text formats. It allows developers to create dynamic web pages by embedding variables, loops, and conditional statements in templates, similar to languages like Django or Jinja2 in Python. Nunjucks is often used in Node.js applications and can be integrated with various web frameworks.
