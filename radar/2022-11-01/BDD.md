Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that encourages collaboration among developers, QA testers, and non-technical stakeholders. It emphasizes defining application behavior in plain language using scenarios that describe how the software should work from the user's perspective. This approach helps ensure that all parties have a shared understanding of the requirements and promotes better communication throughout the development process.
