Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers to manage project dependencies efficiently. It provides a fast, reliable, and secure way to install, update, and configure packages in JavaScript projects, using a lockfile to ensure consistent installations across different environments. Yarn was developed by Facebook to address issues with the npm package manager, such as performance and security.
