Feature switching, also known as feature toggling or feature flags, is a software development practice that allows developers to enable or disable specific functionalities in an application without deploying new code. This technique is often used for testing, gradual rollouts, and managing features in production environments, enabling teams to control the user experience and minimize risk.
