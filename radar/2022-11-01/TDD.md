Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice where developers write automated tests for a feature before implementing the actual code. The process typically follows a cycle of writing a failing test, writing the minimum code necessary to pass the test, and then refactoring the code while ensuring all tests still pass. This approach helps ensure code quality, encourages simplicity, and facilitates better design.
