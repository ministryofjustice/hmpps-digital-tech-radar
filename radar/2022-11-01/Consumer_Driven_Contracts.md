Consumer-driven contracts (CDC) in API programming refer to a testing approach where the consumer of an API defines the expectations for how the API should behave. Instead of the API provider dictating the contract, consumers specify their requirements, ensuring that the API meets their needs. This approach promotes better alignment between API consumers and providers, facilitates collaboration, and helps prevent breaking changes during development. It is often used in microservices architectures to enhance the reliability of interactions between services.
