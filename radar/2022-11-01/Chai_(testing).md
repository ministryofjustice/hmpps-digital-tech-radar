Chai is a popular assertion library for JavaScript used in testing applications. It provides a variety of assertion styles (like BDD, TDD, and assert) that allow developers to write clear and expressive tests. Chai can be used with various testing frameworks, such as Mocha, to enhance the testing experience by enabling easy validation of expected outcomes in code.
