Cypress is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework designed for web applications. It allows developers to write tests that simulate user interactions in a browser, making it easy to test the functionality, performance, and reliability of web applications in real-time. Cypress provides a rich API and a user-friendly interface for creating, running, and debugging tests.
