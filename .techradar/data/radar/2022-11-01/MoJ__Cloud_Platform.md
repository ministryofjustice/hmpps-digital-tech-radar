The Ministry of Justiceâ€™s Cloud Platform is a modern, cloud-native hosting platform for digital services built within the Ministry of Justice.

The Cloud Platform provides a way for teams to:

* deploy a service or application into the cloud
* utilise common tooling, such as monitoring, logging, alerting, and security scanning of container images, without teams needing to configure or manage the infrastructure
* implement zero downtime deploys, scalability, and high availability of services
