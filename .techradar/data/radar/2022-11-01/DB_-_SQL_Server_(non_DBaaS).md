SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. It provides a platform for building, deploying, and managing data-driven applications and supports various features like transaction processing, business intelligence, and analytics. Unlike Database as a Service (DBaaS), SQL Server can be installed and managed on local servers or on-premises environments.
