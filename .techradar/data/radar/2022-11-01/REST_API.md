A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different software applications to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, which are typically represented in formats like JSON or XML. REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process that request.
