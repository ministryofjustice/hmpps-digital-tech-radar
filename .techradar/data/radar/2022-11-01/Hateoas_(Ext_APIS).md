HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of the REST application architecture that allows clients to interact with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by the server. It enables clients to discover available actions and resources by following links embedded in the responses, thereby promoting a more flexible and decoupled interaction between clients and servers.
