PostgreSQL RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL databases in the cloud. It automates tasks such as backups, patching, and scaling, making it easier for developers to manage databases without the need for extensive administrative overhead.
