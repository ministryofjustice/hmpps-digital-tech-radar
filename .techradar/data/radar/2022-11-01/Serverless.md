AWS Serverless refers to a cloud computing model offered by Amazon Web Services that allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. In this model, resources are automatically allocated and scaled based on demand, enabling developers to focus on writing code while AWS handles the underlying server management, provisioning, and scaling. Key services in the AWS Serverless ecosystem include AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Step Functions.
