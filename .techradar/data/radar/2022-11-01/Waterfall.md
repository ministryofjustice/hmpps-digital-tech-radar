Waterfall development is a linear and sequential software development methodology where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance) must be completed before moving on to the next. It emphasizes a structured approach, with defined stages and milestones, making it easy to manage but less flexible in accommodating changes once a phase is completed.
