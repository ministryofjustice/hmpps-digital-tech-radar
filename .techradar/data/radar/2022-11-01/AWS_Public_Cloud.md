AWS Public Cloud refers to Amazon Web Services' suite of cloud computing services that are available to the public over the internet. It provides scalable computing resources, storage, and various services (like machine learning, databases, and analytics) on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing businesses and individuals to leverage powerful infrastructure without the need for on-premises hardware.
