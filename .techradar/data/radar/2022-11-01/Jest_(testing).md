Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook, designed to simplify the process of writing unit tests for JavaScript applications. It provides a robust set of features, including a zero-config setup, built-in assertions, test runners, and tools for mocking and spying on functions, making it easy to test both synchronous and asynchronous code.
