SCRUM is an agile project management framework used primarily in software development that emphasizes collaboration, iterative progress, and flexibility. It organizes work into small, manageable units called "sprints," typically lasting two to four weeks, allowing teams to continuously improve and adapt their products based on feedback and changing requirements. Key roles in SCRUM include the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, and it incorporates regular ceremonies such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives to enhance communication and efficiency.
