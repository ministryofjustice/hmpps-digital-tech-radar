Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) is a managed container orchestration service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure. It automates tasks such as provisioning, scaling, and upgrading Kubernetes clusters, allowing developers to focus on building and running applications without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure.
