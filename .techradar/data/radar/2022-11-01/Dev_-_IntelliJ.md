A cross-platform IDE/source code editor primarily aimed at JVM-based technologies such as Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Scala but it also supports Java EE and web development. An open-source version is available under the name IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, and a proprietary version as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition. IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition can be made to include the feature set of PhpStorm, PyCharm and RubyMine via plugins.
